The High Volume Payment processing platform (HVP3) is a system designed to handle high transaction volumes while ensuring security, scalability, and compliance with industry standards. 

The architecture leverages microservices, cloud-native technologies, and robust security measures to achieve these goals.

As per this is designed for a Fintech company, it is needed to consider the customer need of an instant and seamless financial transaction in multiple currencies and payment methods. The system should be able to handle high transaction volumes, provide real-time processing, and ensure security and compliance with industry regulations.

This financial regulations include PCI DSS, GDPR, and other relevant standards. The system should also be designed to be scalable, flexible, and maintainable to accommodate future growth and changes in the financial landscape.

For integration with other financial institutions, the system should support various APIs and protocols to facilitate seamless communication and data exchange.
